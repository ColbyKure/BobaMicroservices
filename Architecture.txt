# Boba Bear Microservice Architecture (Optimized for Cost)

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of a cost-efficient microservice architecture for Boba Bear, a boba shop chain with multiple locations. The system will manage customer orders, inventory, payments, and notifications while reducing operational costs by merging related services.

## Tech Stack Choices
- **Backend:** Node.js (NestJS), Go, Python (FastAPI), or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- **Messaging Queue:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS
- **Load Balancing & API Gateway:** Nginx, Traefik, or AWS API Gateway
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), or AWS ECS

## Optimized Microservices Architecture

1. **API Gateway (Includes Authentication)**
   - Handles user authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth)
   - Routes requests and implements security policies
   - Reduces the need for a standalone Auth Service

2. **Order & Payment Service**
   - Processes customer orders in real-time
   - Manages order status (placed, in-progress, completed, canceled)
   - Handles transactions via credit card, digital wallets, and loyalty points
   - Ensures secure and PCI-compliant payment processing

3. **Store Operations Service (Inventory + Location Management)**
   - Tracks stock levels for ingredients and supplies across all locations
   - Sends alerts for low-stock items and automates reordering
   - Manages store locations, operating hours, and in-store promotions
   - Supports location-based ordering and pickup scheduling

4. **Loyalty & Notification Service**
   - Tracks customer purchases and applies reward points
   - Manages discount programs and referral bonuses
   - Sends order confirmations, promotional messages, and updates via SMS, email, and push notifications

## Scaling Strategy
- **Database Sharding & Replication:** To distribute transaction load across multiple locations
- **Caching Layer:** Redis or Memcached to reduce DB calls and improve order processing speed
- **Auto-scaling:** Kubernetes HPA or AWS Lambda for dynamic scaling based on traffic

## Security Considerations
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect against DDoS attacks
- **Data Encryption:** Use AES-256 for sensitive data, including payment details
- **PCI-DSS Compliance:** Ensure secure payment transactions

## Development Plan
1. Set up basic infrastructure with Docker and Kubernetes.
2. Implement API Gateway with authentication.
3. Develop Order & Payment Service.
4. Build Store Operations Service.
5. Create Loyalty & Notification Service.
6. Integrate API Gateway and security layers.
7. Deploy and test with real-world scenarios.
